#### A ReactJS Chat Example

The point of this is to see what a prototype of a chat application in ReactJS would feel like.

Check out the WIP <a href='http://ninjapanzer.github.io/React-Chat'>Demo</a>

**My key identifiers are:**

1. Is the code easy to follow
2. How much duplication will I create
3. Does JSX grow ugly fast?
4. Can I achieve single flow data binding
5. How does testing go?

**My conclusions thus far:**

1. The code is pretty easy to follow because a lot of it is very similar and there is little *magic*
2. Right now there is a lot of duplication. I have many repeated dispatchers and store boilerplate. To be honest though having this kind of duplication makes it feel very frameworky and repeatable is good
3. JSX when iterating is very ugly always wrapping output in a map to get repeated items. As a side thought I have considered making the store responsible for iterating but I think the biggest goal is to just break up some of these sections into functions. It is very nice to keep the markup so close to the code. The style too sometimes.
4. I have successfully achieved single flow data binding. It was very easy in fact. Near the bottom of the data we add messages to a channel and trigger a redraw when the item is added to the collection. This is instantanious. I have not load tests it yet with a bunch of messages but in practice we could always enforce a storage history so no matter what we don't have too many messages on screen.
5. Their test tools are wondrous. But Jest the target test framework hasnâ€™t been updated to work with 0.12 or iojs making it extremely hard to work around JSX. So I spent about 4 hours trying to get karma and jasmine running with the correct preprocessors for JSX and coffee with CommonJS and its just a mess. I know that webpack adds to some of this complication because it lets me be lasy about require statements but I think the only reason I will abandom React at some point is how complicated setting up testing is. My first react project died on the vine because I tried to tdd it. That said if you just need to prototype something small and fast its killer.

**I love React and Backbone together**

#### Running this

- This now uses iojs so you should install nvm https://github.com/creationix/nvm and install iojs of at least version 2.3.0 as listed in the package.json
- When converting you will probably have to reinstall your globals too if they don't work

##### Globals
I am assuming that you have node and redis installed to build this project. Although I am not quite using redis yet the dev server spins up redis.

You will need these global node modules
- foreman
- webpack, webpack-cli
- coffeescript

Project setup:

- `bower install`
- `npm install`
- test with `npm run build`
- run `nf start -j Procfile.development`
- `open http://localhost:8080`

Configuration. This does not consume an api right now and uses local fakedata. You will find it in the fakedata folder. Feel free to expand the defitions to add more channels and users.
